// Upcoming functionality: Scrape ingredients from webpage and identify harmful ones

// Steps to implement:
// 1. Scrape item ingredients from the webpage, specifically for items added to the shopping cart.
// 2. Cross-reference each item's ingredients against a predefined list of harmful ingredients.
// 3. If a match is found, flag the ingredient as harmful.
// 4. Display a notification to the user indicating which item contains the harmful ingredient.
// 5. Provide an option for the user to remove the flagged item from their cart.

// This outlines the planned approach for identifying and alerting users about harmful ingredients in their shopping cart items.

// Additonally in the future an ingredient API could be used to provide more detailed information about the harmful ingredients.
